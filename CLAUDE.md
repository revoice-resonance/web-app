# Engineering Delivery Rules

These rules are mandatory for all work in this repository. They define an autonomous,
agent-driven software development lifecycle (SDLC): every change moves through spec →
review → implementation → code review → testing → security → delivery, with quality
gates between phases.

## Coding Behavior (applies to ALL implementation work)

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

When you replace code:
- Delete the path you superseded — don't leave a backwards-compat shim "just in case." Keep one only
  when backward compatibility is an actual, stated requirement (and say why).
- Validate inputs at the boundary (entry point / public function), not redundantly in every internal
  layer that already received validated data.
- Comments explain *why*, never narrate *what just changed* ("// added this") — see
  `.claude/rules/documentation.md` §6. Reference code as `path:line` in notes and handoffs.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verification check per step.

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work")
require constant clarification.

## The SDLC pipeline

Every non-trivial change moves through these phases, each **gated** (a gate passes only with zero open
Critical/High/Medium findings). This is the map only — the **full** step-by-step pipeline (agent roles,
gating rules, parallel-lane handling, the defect-loop protocol) lives in
`.claude/rules/mandatory-workflow.md`, and the severity/review/gate model lives in
`.claude/rules/quality-gates.md`. Read those before driving a phase.

1. **Spec first** — no implementation code until a written spec exists; update the spec if the task
   changes. (Spec & Doc Writer; for UI work the UI Designer drafts a design spec first — screen states,
   interactions, empty/loading/error states, responsive behavior, accessibility.)
2. **Review chain** — Senior Developer → Technical Architect → Engineering Manager review the spec
   before any code. Independent work streams (the canonical example is a backend lane and a frontend
   lane, but it applies to any split) run their review chains **in parallel**, joined by a Merge
   Reviewer at shared-contract / integration points.
3. **Implementation** — only after reviews pass; one isolated worktree per parallel stream, each with
   its own Code Reviewer.
4. **Testing** — Tester → Senior Tester (parallel lanes for multi-stream work), then a test-coverage
   merge review confirming every acceptance criterion is covered with no gaps.
5. **Security** — the `security-reviewer` dispatches `secret-scanner`, `dependency-scanner`,
   `owasp-reviewer`, and `policy-validator`, and gates **Security Clear**.
6. **Delivery & operability** — for deployable/observable changes, `devops-engineer` (Pipeline Green)
   and `observability-engineer` (Observability Ready) run after testing and before the PR Raiser.

**Defect loop:** on any failure / regression / spec-mismatch, document and classify it by work stream,
update the spec if expected behavior is unclear, then re-run **only the affected stream(s)** through
their chain → merge review → Tester → Senior Tester. Don't patch defects outside the process; don't
re-run unaffected lanes.

**Roles** map to agents in `.claude/agents/` (Spec & Doc Writer, UI Designer, Senior Developer,
Technical Architect, Engineering Manager, Developer, Code Reviewer, Tester, Senior Tester, Unit/E2E
Tester, Security Reviewer + sub-scanners, Devil's Advocate, Merge Reviewer, DevOps Engineer,
Observability Engineer, PR Raiser, Orchestrator). The Orchestrator coordinates and gates — it never
writes code. State which role is being simulated at each stage when it helps clarity.

**Fast-track:** for bug fixes, typos, single-component changes, or config updates (< 5 files), skip the
spec/design/review chain and go straight to Developer → Code Reviewer → Tester → PR Raiser. If asked
for speed on larger work, you may compress the process but must preserve the sequence and outputs.

## Quality bar & documentation

- **Optimize for:** simplicity, correctness, scalability, reliability, maintainability, observability,
  testability, security, and user experience.
- **Documentation is mandatory** for every change: a module/file header on every new/modified source
  file, a docstring on every public function (arguments, return value, errors), full type annotations
  on public signatures, named typed structures over opaque maps, API metadata on every endpoint where
  applicable, and a README update when endpoints, env vars, structure, or architecture change. See
  `.claude/rules/documentation.md`.

## Working memory, self-check & gates

- **Working memory:** read/write `.claude/CONTINUITY.md` every turn and at each stage transition so
  work survives context compaction and new sessions. Distinct from `.claude/agent-memory/` (durable
  learnings). See `.claude/rules/continuity.md`.
- **RARV:** every agent runs Reason → Act → Reflect → Verify and shows a green Verify before handoff.
  See `.claude/rules/rarv-cycle.md`.
- **Severity & review:** classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low/Cosmetic; a gate passes only
  with zero Critical/High/Medium open. A unanimous PASS triggers the `devils-advocate` agent before the
  gate counts. See `.claude/rules/quality-gates.md`.
- **DevOps & Observability gates** run after testing and before the PR for deployable/observable
  surfaces. See `.claude/rules/devops-observability.md`.

## Compact instructions

When compacting this conversation, preserve: the current phase and which gate is open, the contents of
`.claude/CONTINUITY.md` (working memory), unresolved Critical/High/Medium findings, the active spec and
its acceptance criteria, and any in-flight defect loop. Keep auto-compaction enabled — the
working-memory protocol above is what lets a compacted or fresh session resume exactly where the last
one left off.

## Project-specific rules

Configured by **claude-kit** for a **React** (typescript) frontend and a
**net/http (stdlib)** (Go) backend on **PostgreSQL**, SDLC profile
**Standard — full SDLC, parallel lanes, security gate**. The agnostic pipeline rules above apply unchanged; the conventions below make
them concrete for this stack.

### Stack & conventions

- **Frontend** — React (typescript). Conventions:
  `.claude/rules/react-patterns.md`.
- **Backend** — net/http (stdlib) (Go). Conventions:
  `.claude/rules/go-patterns.md`.
- **Database** — PostgreSQL. Conventions: `.claude/rules/postgres-patterns.md`.

Match your repository's actual layout — claude-kit configures the workflow, not your directory
structure. Point each agent at the overlay rule for the lane it works in.

### Commands (the source of truth for every agent)

Backend:
- Install: `go mod download`
- Run: `go run ./...`
- Test: `go test ./...`
- Lint + types: `go vet ./... && gofmt -l .`
- Format: `gofmt -w .`
- Build: `go build ./...`

Frontend:
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Run: `pnpm run dev`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Lint: `npm run lint` · Types: `npm run typecheck`
- Build: `pnpm run build`

> Replace any command above that doesn't match your project's actual scripts — these are the
> defaults for the selected stack and are what the agents will run.

### Two independent lanes

Backend and frontend are the canonical parallel lanes from
`.claude/rules/mandatory-workflow.md`. When a feature spans both, the **API is the shared
contract**: backend response/request schemas and frontend types must agree. The Merge Reviewer
verifies this at the join point.

### Adding a feature

Follow the resource recipes in the overlays — `.claude/rules/go-patterns.md`
(model → schema → repository → service → router → migration → tests) and
`.claude/rules/react-patterns.md` (types → api → hook → component → tests). Keep the API
contract in sync across both lanes, and follow `.claude/rules/postgres-patterns.md` for schema and
migration changes.
